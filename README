This is just an idea.

I have a few major sections:

* site/ is for the website only
* tools/ is for any and all tools we might develop (could also go in separate repositories, I'm a fan of monorepos)
* content/ this is the actual content we have, in multiple languages and formats, including labs, assets etc.
* training/ this would then build a coherent product out of one or more pieces of content
